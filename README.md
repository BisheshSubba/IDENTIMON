<h1>üêæ AI-Powered Animal Identifier (Pok√©dex Edition)</h1>

<p>
The <strong>AI-Powered Animal Identifier</strong> is a web-based system designed to identify animals from images with over 
<strong>80% prediction accuracy</strong>. Styled in the theme of <strong>Pok√©mon</strong> and the iconic <strong>Pok√©dex</strong>, 
the platform provides users with a fun and interactive way to explore AI-driven animal recognition.
</p>

<p>
Powered by a <strong>ResNet-34</strong> pre-trained deep learning model, the system can accurately classify 
<strong>10 different animal species</strong> using image analysis. The model was trained on a 
<strong>Kaggle animal dataset</strong>, ensuring robust performance and reliability.
</p>

<p>
The frontend interface is built using <strong>Django</strong>, combining a sleek Pok√©dex-inspired design with smooth 
user interaction. Users can upload or drag-and-drop images, and the system instantly predicts the animal type, 
displays the confidence level, and provides a fun fact about the identified animal.
